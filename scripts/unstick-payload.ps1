# unstick-payload.ps1 — pre-build helper for WM_NIGHThook.vcxproj.
#
# A global WH_CBT hook DLL lingers, still mapped, in every process it touched until
# that process pumps a message after we unhook — which locks the file so the linker
# can't overwrite it on the next build (LNK1168). A mapped image CAN still be renamed,
# so: if the current payload DLL is locked, move it aside to .dll.<6 digits> so a
# fresh one links; then sweep aside-copies that have since been released. Run only when
# the DLL is actually locked, so an up-to-date incremental build keeps its output (and a
# locked-but-stale build self-heals: the now-missing output forces a relink).
